            <h1>About FynApp</h1>
            <p>FynApp is an application to achieve weight loss goals and maintain a better lifestyle, based on proper nutrition, a positive mindset, and physical activity. Inspired by the principles of Caloric Deficit and Intermittent Fasting, the idea was born when one of the founders needed a practical tool to count daily calories with ingredients and recipes made by oneself, raising awareness of the most convenient foods, most filling, the ones you like the most, the ones you can pay for and provide fewer calories, and he didn't found something that fit his needs in the Apps market.</p>
            <p>FYN = Fit You Need (Just as Yoda would say).</p>
